# Topic

Pick some subset of the information covered in your annual review article that you are interested in exploring in more detail. 

Identify the scope of your user guide - what will you cover? Specific software packages? When to use or not to use a specific technique?
I may try to create a model to determine how many wins a team will get based on different sports statistics. However, not sure if I can do this. I will try to use R but am open to any other software. I am not sure what technique means in this context.
