What are the basic requirements for any data on which the method is used? - Are missing values allowed?

-   No, missing values are not allowed

Should the data be confined within a certain range?

-   Yes, they should be positive integers

Does the data have to be approximately normally distributed?

-   No, but the comparisons should be independent of each other.

What are the basic components of the task? - Outline these in a bit more detail

1.  The user should collect data in a way that sets up data as (competitor 1, competitor 2, Wins for 1, wins for B)

2.  They should clean the data to remove duplicate, negative, or missing values.

3.  They should pick the appropriate software packages in R/Python.

4.  They start by using software to fit the data and document it to help you remember later.

5.  They should interpret the fitting results and look to see if the model is a good fit with the expected results.

What decisions does the user need to be prepared to make on the fly?

-   They may need to decide whether a different model should be used if the outcomes donâ€™t align. They may also need to determine whether the dataset is valid and needs manipulation.

What questions should the user ask of the "first draft" of the product? What adjustments need to be made?

-   Does the model fit well with the expected outcome? Should I be using a different model like the Elo or Glicko? How can I make the model more accurate? They may need to manipulate data better, tweak the code, or use a different software package or model.
